                A healthy diet includes a variety of foods that provide the nutrients your body needs to maintain health, feel good, and have energy. These nutrients include protein, carbohydrates, fat, water, vitamins, and minerals. Eating a balanced diet means consuming the right quantities of foods from all food groups to achieve and maintain optimal health.

Limiting the intake of processed foods, sugar, and excessive fats is also crucial in maintaining a healthy eating pattern.
